## Code to calculate molecular dynamics of coase-grained chromatins composing mitotic chromosomes

This Code is used in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of coase-grained chromatins composing mitotic chromosomes. \
Figures 5, 7, S6, S10, Movie S5-S9, S12-S17 in the paper were calculated using this code.

Extensible Simulation Package for Research on Soft Matter (ESPResSo) [1] is an MD package, which features a broad range of interaction potentials. 
ESPResSo is used as an MD simulator in this study as in our previous works [2-4].

MD time evolution programs of ESPResSo are written in C. The scripting language, Tcl, provides the interface between the user and the simulation engine. Therefore, the user may interact with the parallelized package core, as well as modify simulation parameters during runtime via Tcl commands. 
Detailed guide to ESPResSo is found in the papers [1,4].


The tcl file "chromatin_motion.tcl" is the executable for the MD simulation. \
The file "polymer.init" is an example of the initial coordination file for chromatin.

Execute at the command prompt with the following command;\
./Espresso chromatin_motion.tcl


One calculation usually takes several hours.\
Four output files are generated when the calculation is run.\
One is the "polymer.vtf" file, which is a time series of Cartesian coordinates for each components (5000 chromatin beads, 100 condensin Is and 25 condensin IIs), which can be visualized in vmd or PyMOL.
The others are the "MSD0", "MSD1", and "MSD2" file, which is the mean squared displacement of the nucleosomes in the overall, axial, and peripheral regions, respectively.

Examples of these outputs are in out_putfile and the calculation conditions are similar to those set out in Fig. 5a (shorter calculation time).
